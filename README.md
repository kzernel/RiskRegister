# RiskRegister
📊 Risk Register Web App

A lightweight, browser-based risk register designed for project managers and teams to log, prioritize, and visualize project risks.

## 🔍 Purpose

This tool was built to demonstrate how even simple technical solutions can enhance project visibility and stakeholder communication. It reflects core project management practices—specifically in risk management—and showcases the ability to translate process into code.

## 🛠 Features

- Add new risks with:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Probability (1–5)
  - Impact (1–5)
- Auto-calculates **Risk Score** = Probability × Impact
- Sorts risks by score, descending (highest priority on top)
- Fully client-side with `localStorage` (no backend needed)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS, no frameworks)
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)

- Quantitative risk scoring
- Continuous risk logging
- Visibility of risk priority
